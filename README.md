👋 Hi, I'm @JordanVencel! 

👀 I'm interested in data science/ML, AI, and bounding towards a future with safe AGI.

🌱 I'm currently learning about all the varieties of ML models, training them, and how to choose the correct one for the job at hand.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects involving large-scale contributions to user-facing ML/AI applications and to data science at large.

📫 How to reach me: You can reach out via email at jordanvmartinez@gmail.com.
